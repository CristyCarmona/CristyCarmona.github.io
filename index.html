    <h1>Cristina Carmona Biography</h1>
    <p>I'm a Data Analyst with experience in process improvement consulting. I have worked for different industries like hospitals, retailers, brewing companies, and so on. The diversity of my experience 
        has given me the ability to be adaptable according to the necessity, be focused on the results, and worked more as a leader than a boss.</p>
    <p>I believe that improvement culture does not apply just to companies. So during the last two years, I have been working on new abilities
        like proficiency in the English language,  better tools for data analysis (Python, MySql, APIs, etc.), and certifications as Advanced Excel by Microsoft.</p>
